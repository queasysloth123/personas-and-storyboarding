                        <p>Amy is a college student who likes to try new things. She decides to try boba for the first time and orders with Snackpass's kiosk.
                            She proceeds to look through all the menu items, but the icons are too big and take up a lot of space, making the menu feel more overwhelming than it actually is.
                            She also has dietary restrictions and wishes for a way to filter the menu or at least see common allergenic ingredients in each menu item before proceeding to select toppings/sides. 
                            Because Amy is taking to long to choose her order, the kiosk times out and terminates her session. Amy tries again, and ends up getting brown sugar boba with soy milk.

                            He sees the long line to the cashier and becomes worried that he won't get his drink in time. He, instead, orders on Snackpass's kiosk, selecting the first item on the  menu.
                            He pays for his drink, and is offered a discount if he enters his phone number. He is disappointed that he link it to his Snackpass account because he is one gift away from 
                            hatching an egg with his friend. He enters his number, but his order fails to go through. Joe is upset, tries again, and successfully orders his drink.
